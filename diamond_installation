#the Diamond program is not available as a module in MSI; it has to be installed and set up 
#in MSI. 

#downloading the program by default this command will bring the file into your home directory
wget http://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond/releases/download/v2.1.11/diamond-linux64.tar.gz

#installing the program
tar xzf diamond-linux64.tar.gz

#Together these commands will instsall the program in your home directory, from which you 
#can then move it into any directory (such as the group directory, or into your local bin directory).
#However, when you go to run the program, you will need to add the directory into which you installed 
#the file into your $PATH ($PATH being the list of directories through which the shell script will 
#search for programs in response to commands).
#This can be accomplished through the following command:
export PATH="/insert/directory/here:$PATH"
